Solution to http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder
in python

This is my take on the challenge. 

- uses a simple idea of a distance metric between pixel columns(slice edges)
- no magic "weights" or constants
- detects slice width if not given*
- fairly robust - could be improved
- *very fast*

* doesn't work perfectly, sometimes detects widths which are factors of the actual width
this is harmless as the unshredder still works
